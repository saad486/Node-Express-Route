# Node-Express-Route

Experimented with Express API routes. Added three routes dishRouter, promoRouter and leaderRouter.

## How to setup
1) 'npm install' to install the dependencies
2) 'npm start' to start the server
3)  Postman is used for experiment and generating different http request. Browser can also be used
